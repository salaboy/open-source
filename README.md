# Open Source
Open Source References, Links, Ideas and thoughts. 

After working for some years in different companies that prometed Open Source as part of their core believes I've came to meet a lot of people who explained and promoted Open Source in different ways. Some more passionate, some very practical, some very theoretical, so I will use this repository to keep track of ideas and thougths about how Open Source initiatives impacts different communities, companies and organizations. 

As part of my Open Source Journey, a recent involvement that I had was with the Jenkins X Community and you can read more about that [here](https://salaboy.com/2020/05/19/why-isnt-jenkins-xs-future-more-open/).
